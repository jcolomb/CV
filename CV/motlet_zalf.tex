Dear  Prof. Dr. Lischeid,

I am a former biologist who has been following open science movements over the last five years. I have been mostly active in the open data and data management side of open science, trying to develop tools to bring open data as the default behaviour. 

As a scientists, I have a long record of project presentations, collaborative working and student supervision. I am a self-taught R developer and I am particularly interested in applying open science principle (online collaborative working, open leadership, open FAIR data) to my work.
In spite of my relatively small experience with databases, I think I may suit the position: I do understand the problematic of open FAIR data and the need for flexible, tidy, computer and human readable formats for data and metadata. I am used to work in a multi-national and multi-lingual environment. 

On top of my experience with Rshiny for interactive web application (see my last manuscript about an application to archive and analyse mouse behavioural data at \url{https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxwpffyxfbzm}), I am developing new skills in the development of static web site in my work at the data management helpdesk in the Friedrich-Schiller Universit\"{a}t of Jena (\url{https://zealous-johnson-d4652e.netlify.com}). I also have experience in grant writing, understand the problems of scientists and got teaching experience (see also \url{http://rpubs.com/j_colomb/workshops}).

I only got recently to hear about this job proposal from Mrs. Jana Rumler and I had no time to investigate the current situation of data management at your institution. I anyway hope I will learn more about your work while being interviewed.
 
Sincerely yours,\\
