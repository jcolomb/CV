\section* {Motivation letter}

I hereby apply for the  positions "Business Intelligence Analyst (m/f)" 

I am a fluent user of R to analyse data, have good knowledge of SQL, a PhD in neuroscience and I developed my own KPI for my startup Drososhare GmbH (which are calculated from our database; the most important ones are posted automatically here:  \url{https://plot.ly/~j_colomb/0/number-of-users-over-time/}).  I love to find pragmatic and efficient solutions to the problems, with an agile methodology. Working in a team is what I miss the most from my time in the academia and would love to get new challenges in a nice and lively environmnent.

It seemed I could fit that position and would love to hear more about it in a personal meeting. I am working free lance at the moment, and could therefore work a soon as possible.

I am looking forward to meet you in person,

Dr. Julien Colomb
