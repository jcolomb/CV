Dear M. Dreyer,

As discussed during the FDmentor meeting, I am sending you my application to work as a substitute of Ms Helbig, who I first met during the open con satellite event I co-organised in 2016.  

I am a former neurobiologist who has been following open science and open access movements over the last five years. As a scientists, I have a long record of project presentations and collaborative working. I am particularly interested in applying open science principle (online collaborative working, open leadership, open FAIR data) to my work and therefore started to develop an open community around my current work at the research data management helpdesk in Jena. We are indeed building promotion material for data management (\url{https://github.com/open-science-promoters/RDM_promotion}) and welcome any participation. I am also part of other open source initiatives like \url{www.reagents.io} and \url{www.opensciencemooc.eu}. In addition, I recently volunteered to help FORCE11 with their online communication strategies.


During the last years, I have been meeting different actors of the open science community by participating to  several conferences (open science barcamp, Force17, .csv conference,..) and by being invited to different interviews for positions linked to open science and data management (TUHH, TIB, Th\"{u}ringer Hochschulen, dariah, labfolder, German biobank node,  Go FAIR, ...).
 I realized that I have still a lot to learn about the world of libraries and about the  most effective communication strategies to use in that community, and I would be highly motivated to learn while working in your team. I was very impressed by the size of the landscape of your services, and I think it is too bad I never got to hear from it during my work as a scientist at the HU. 
 
I therefore believe that owing to my education, my skill set and my interest for the dissemination of open science practices, I am qualified for the position. I think it would be a great opportunity for me to learn to work with librarian. I hope to get the pleasure to meet you again for an interview.
 
Sincerely yours,\\
