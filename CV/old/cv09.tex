%\subsection* {Research results: main achievements}

%My PhD thesis investigated the larval chemosensory system and focused on two different issues. The main work was directed on organizational aspects and tried to show that the \textit{Drosophila} larva could serve as a gustatory model system of general importance. In the second issue, I studied unexpected effects of olfactory preexposure on further response to this odorant.

%During my postdoctoral fellowship in Paris, I investigated the dynamic of appetitive learning in  \textit{Drosophila}. I developed a new test of sugar motivation, which is sensitive enough to measure differences in flies starved for 14 versus 21 hours. Using this test, I showed that \textit{tequila}, a neurotrypsin orthologue involved in aversive long term memory formation, was surprisingly involved in the response to sugar after starvation. Using the cycloheximide drug, I also proved that long lasting appetitive memory was dependent on protein synthesis, irrespective of the number and spacing of conditioning sessions, starvation length or US strength. This work will lead the way toward more reliable interpretation of appetitive memory data.

%\subsection {Organization of the larval primary taste center}

%In the first of two articles, we studied the targets of gustatory afferents, making use of the genetic tools available in \textit{Drosophila}. Using fluorescent reporters, confocal microscopy and 3D reconstructions, we were able to distinguish two main primary gustatory target regions in the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG), a region behind the brain proper: a median area associated exclusively with projections from internal taste organs (located along the pharynx), and a lateral area, which receives gustatory input from both internal organs and external organs (sitting at the tip of the head). Within these areas, taste afferents do not appear to segregate further, although a combination of behavioral and anatomical data suggested to us that neuron projections might segregate according to the hedonic value of the sensed tastant (good or bad). The second article presents the anatomy of each of the 20 neurons expressing the \textit{hugin} neuropeptide, which were shown to be involved in feeding behavior. This study used similar techniques to the first one and was done in collaboration with M. Pankratz in Germany. Arborizations of  \textit{hugin} neurons, presumably of dendritic nature, were shown to be close to taste projections or even overlap with them. They are either restricted to a median area or cover the whole lateral area of the SOG, reminiscent of the terminal arborizations of taste afferents. Thus, both primary taste neurons and their likely target neurons may be able to distinguish between ingested and non-ingested tastants. In an "extra-view" article about this work in FLY (in press), I also compared this system to the mammalian one, proposing a different organization of the molecular ("What is it?") versus the hedonic ("Is it good?") representation of taste in the two species.


%\subsection {Effect of odor exposure on subsequent responses}

%In a pure behavioral study, I tested the response of larvae toward an odorant after preexposure to that odorant. This protocol was previously thought to lead to olfactory adaptation, i.e. a loss in sensitivity toward that odor. However, critical experiments were able to show that the larval responses can change from attraction to repulsion, an evidence that demonstrates that pre-exposure induces a change in the hedonic value of the odor, rather than reducing olfactory sensitivity as interpreted in prior studies. We postulated the presence of an  associative learning in these tests, although we were not able to identify the negative stimulus which might have been associated with the odor. Indeed, we showed that the absence of food was not such a stimulus.

%\section {Present expertise and potentials}

\subsection* {Project management and leadership skills}

During my PhD thesis and my post-doctoral experience, I both developed and demonstrated the abilities of independent initiative and creative thinking. I had the opportunity to propose, develop and then bring to fruition my own projects. I also gained skills in presentation of results. I indeed presented my work in different congresses; in particular, I gave an oral presentation in the 2006 neurofly meeting, which gathered the whole community of neuroscientists working on \textit{Drosophila}.
I already took great part in the redaction of the papers of my thesis, but I recently became  able to write a whole paper (and mini-review) with little help from my supervisors.
 Furthermore, I have been learning to elaborate long term and more integrated projects, thanks to my post-doctoral training.
%In addition, I recently modified a test measuring feeding behaviors for the motivation test described in section~\ref{sec:paradigms}.
All these elements demonstrate my abilities to take initiative and to manage a project from its beginning to its end. 

I also took part in the supervision of a student, who worked on a related but different topic (olfactory discrimination). Moreover, as a co-director in the theatre group of the University, I also gained experience in the difficult task of group management. 

%\subsection{Match between my profile and project}

%The first part of the project involves behavioral paradigms, in which I have some expertise. At the beginning of my scientific career, I worked under the supervision of B. Gerber, who is an expert in behavioral paradigm elaboration. I thus learned the extreme rigor needed in this type of experiments. Moreover, I took part in a summer course on learning and memory in Cold Spring Harbor, where I got to know the backgrounds of learning and memory theories. On the other hand, I worked with confocal microscopy during my thesis. This is a good basis from which to learn more sophisticated functional imaging techniques.

%\subsection{Potential to acquire new knowledge}

%I showed my abilities to learn new skills by being able to effectively use the behavioral tools of the lab in one month (while three months are normally planned). I am looking forward to enter the world of functional imaging, although tthis is likely to prove more difficult, since I do not yet have all the theoretical background needed. 

%\subsection {Maturity}

%I am profoundly interested in discovering the neurobiological bases of learning and memory, and believe that \textit{Drosophila} is a very powerful model system to work on these questions. 
%I have already been introduced to the tools used in the lab, but until now I lacked the opportunity to work on learning, since such studies demand great expertise in behavioral techniques. I thus believe that the practical experience, the scientific interaction and the opportunity to work on this specific question will be crucial to enable me to become competent to reach a position of professional maturity and independence in the field of learning and memory.
