Dear Dr. Carnabuci,

Owing to my long experience in data analysis using R and research, I believe I am qualified for the position.

I am a self-taught R developer and I am particularly interested in applying open science principle (online collaborative working, open leadership, open FAIR data) to my work (see the project, developped in R, that I am leading at the university of Jena at  \url{https://rdmpromotion.rbind.io}).

I am presently working part time in the informatics institute in Jena, working for the research data management helpdesk and could use some extra revenues. I would be glad to work in a novel environment and meet new people. 

I therefore think I have the experience and motivation you need for this position and would be happy to meet you in person for an interview to know more about your research interests and how I could help the team produce great research.

 As you might imagine, the salary would have to be adjusted to my qualifications and I would be happy to discuss it further.



 
Sincerely yours,\\
