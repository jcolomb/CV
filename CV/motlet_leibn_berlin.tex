Dear Dr. Opitz,

Owing to my deep interest in open science, my long experience in research and my skill-set in project communication, team work and digital tools usage, I believe I am qualified for the position of research referent in open science and digitalisation. Since my first meeting with Lambert Heller at the  open science barcamp in 2016 and during our common work on the openscience MOOC, I have been very interested and impressed by the work of the Leibnitz-association in shaping the future of research and I would be delighted to help your initiatives with my knowledge, skills and enthusiasm.

I am a former researcher (in neuro-biology) who has been closely following open science movements over the last five years. I have been co-organising the Berlin open science meetups series for the last 3 years, gathering knowledge about the whole spectrum of the open science problematic and its players (institutions, communities and companies). I have been mostly active in its open data and data management side (including metadata production, and standards for material description, see \url{http://www.reagents.io}).

I have a long record of project presentations (written and oral), collaborative working and student supervision. I am a self-taught R developer and I am particularly interested in applying open science principle (online collaborative working, open leadership, open FAIR data) to my work (see the project I am leading at the university of Jena at  \url{https://rdmpromotion.rbind.io}. I am used to work in a multi-national and multi-lingual environment. Leading the AOCF at the Charit\'{e},  I gathered experience in team management (using the knowledge I gain following the group management and moderation workshop organised at the FU). 

I therefore think I have the experience and motivation you need for this position and would be happy to meet you in person for an interview.



 
Sincerely yours,\\
