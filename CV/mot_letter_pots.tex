\section* {Motivation letter}

I hereby apply for the positions of Projektmitarbeiter/-in, Kennziffer   71/20107.

I am fluently using R and shiny to do my statistics, which allow reproducibility of the analysis (once new data is fed, only one click allow for a re-run of the analysis) and a good user experience (browser based interface), you might have a look at https://colomb.shinyapps.io/Flystockcleaner/ to get an idea. Moving to jasperstudio, if necessary, should be easy.

I have been working at the university for years, as a research and teaching assistant. I am looking for a part time position, since it would allow me to continue my voluntary work in projects like the open science mooc and the march for science. 

I am looking forward to meet you in person,
Dr. Julien Colomb
